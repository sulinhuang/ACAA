ACAA (Alpha Calculate anti-aliasing) is a very fast and high-quality Game GPU anti-aliasing scheme.

for two part:

part one ACAA Super 256x is a Guide to use a new Algorithm Render MSAA 256x very fast in GPU.so that MSAA 256x can be run very fast in GPU.and also use much less video memory and computation.that core Algorithm will let MSAA 256x anti-aliasing run very fast.Game anti-aliasing will no ghost, no blur, and time is stable.Improve the anti-aliasing quality of FPS frames as much as possible.

so that all GPU and all games can be run MSAA 256x very fast. and also Deferred Rendering can use MSAA 256x.

We can make the anti-aliasing quality of real-time rendering of the game approach or even exceed the SSAA 256x.

part two ACAA image-filter is a image filter to change NOAA image all part to anti-aliasing image.
