ACAA (Alpha Calculate anti-aliasing) is a very fast and high-quality Game GPU anti-aliasing scheme.

for two part:

part one ACAA Super 256x is a Guide to use a new Algorithm Render MSAA 256x very fast in GPU.so that MSAA 256x can be run very fast in GPU.and also use much less video memory and computation.that core Algorithm will let MSAA 256x anti-aliasing run very fast.Game anti-aliasing will no ghost, no blur, and time is stable.Improve the anti-aliasing quality of FPS frames as much as possible.

so that all GPU and all games can be run MSAA 256x very fast. and also Deferred Rendering can use MSAA 256x.

We can make the anti-aliasing quality of real-time rendering of the game approach or even exceed the SSAA 256x.
ACAA Super 256x is for 100% resolution Game.let game has MSAA 256x anti-aliasing.

part two ACAA image-filter is a image filter to change NOAA image all part to anti-aliasing image.
For most games, rendering the game to 100%-125% resolution NOAA image, using ACAA anti-aliasing processing program, and resampling it to 1920x1080 can obtain good anti-aliasing quality and performance, such as the target 1920x1080 picture, rendering it to 2560x1440 NOAA, using ACAA anti-aliasing and resampling it back to 1920x1080.This means that only 1.5xSSAA+ACAA can get good anti-aliasing game picture and performance.
